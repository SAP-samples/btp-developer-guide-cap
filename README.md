# SAP BTP Developer's Guide

## Overview

The goal of the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide is to help you implement business applications on SAP BTP. The SAP BTP Developer's Guide explains the building blocks for developing, delivering, and integrating business applications.
Development projects for business applications have similar characteristics. Standardized development guidance is driving developer efficiency.
The Incident Management sample application is a showcase of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and adheres to the development recommendations set out in the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide. Best practices are documented in step-by-step tutorials based on the Incident Management application for learning how to develop, deploy, and operate a full-stack application using CAP and SAP Fiori. The tutorials also show how to use a set of important SAP BTP services in a CAP application.

## Business Scenario

The Incident Management application uses the following sample business scenario:

ACME is a popular Electronics company. ACME hires call center support representatives to process and manage customer incidents. A call center support representative (Processor) receives a phone call from an existing customer and creates a new incident on behalf of the customer. The newly created incident is based on a customer complaint received during the phone call so the call center support representative also adds the conversation with the customer to the incident.
