6. To give project details, do the following:

    1. Enter **project Name** as `Incidents<your-initials><unique-random-number>`. For example, if your name is `John Doe`, then the project name would be **Incidentsjd12**, (12 is some random number).

        > **Note:** Project name should be unique because to identify your project during deployment phase and also to avoid duplication error.

    2. Select **Node.js** from the **Development stack** dropdown.
    3. You can use the existing Dev Space instead of creating a new Dev space. Let the **Full_Stack** be the default Dev Space.
    4. Click on **Create**.
