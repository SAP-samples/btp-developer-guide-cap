# Create a Full-Stack Application

This section explains how to access the SAP Build lobby and create a full-stack application using SAP Build Code.

1. Open the [SAP Build Lobby](https://sit-buildcode.ap10.build.cloud.sap/index.html).

2. To create a new project, choose **Create**.

6. Specify the following project details:

    1. Enter `Incidents<your-initials><unique-random-number>` in the **Project Name** field. For example, if your name is `John Doe`, then the project name would be **Incidentsjd12**, (12 is some random number).

        > **Note:** The project name should be unique to identify your project during deployment and also to avoid a duplication error.

    2. Select **Node.js** from the **Development stack** dropdown.
    3. You can use the existing Dev Space instead of creating a new one. Let **Full_Stack** be the default Dev Space.
    4. Choose **Create**.

7. Wait for the project to get created. Once it's created, click the project, which opens in a new tab.
