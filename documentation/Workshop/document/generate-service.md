# Create a Service Using Joule

This section describes how to generate services using Joule.

## Prerequisites

You have enhanced the sample data following the steps at [Enhance Sample Data](enhance-sample-data.md).

## Ccreate a Service

1. Choose the **Joule** icon. Start typing ```/cap-edit``` in the Joule prompt and select **/cap-edit-model** from the suggestions to create a service.

    ![edit-model](../images/generate-service/editmodel.png)

    > **Note:** By default, **/cap-edit-model #db/schema.cds** should be displayed in a text box.

    ![cap-edit-model](../images/generate-service/prompt_start.png)

2. The Joule prompt will be prefilled with **/cap-edit-model #db/schema.cds**. Paste the following prompt to generate a service:

    ```html
    Add 1 service named 'ProcessorService' as projection on the entity 'Incidents' and readonly for 'Customers' and Add 1 service named 'AdminService' on projection for Customers and Incidents entity and remove other services. Annotate ProcessorService with Support role and AdminService with admin role. Remove path properties.
    ```

3. Choose the **Send** icon.

    ![cap-edit-model-prompt](../images/generate-service/prompt.png)

4. Choose **Accept**.

    ![cap-accept-service](../images/generate-service/accept-edit-model.png)


5. For OData draft enabling, use the following prompt to make ProcessorService to draft enable. Start typing `/cap-edit`, and select **/cap-edit-model** from the suggestions.

    ```
    Annotate Processor Service with odata draft enable for incidents entity.
    ```

6. Choose the **Send** icon.

    ![validate-edit-model](../images/generate-service/prompt2.png)

7. Choose **Accept**.

    ![accept-edit-service](../images/generate-service/accept-edit-service.png)

8. Go to **Storyboard**. In the **Services** section, make sure **AdminService** and **ProcessorService** have been created.

    ![validate-edit-model](../images/generate-service/validate-edit-model.png)

9. Open **service.cds** in the project explorer and validate the generated service. 

    ![validate-gen-service](../images/generate-service/code_struct.png)

10. Joule may generate different codes for the same prompt. Make sure the generated service is aligned with the following code.

```
using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/schema.cds';

@requires: 'Support'
service ProcessorService {
    @odata.draft.enabled
    entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;
    @readonly
    entity Customers as projection on my.Customers;
}

@requires: 'admin'
service AdminService {
    entity Customers as projection on my.Customers;
    entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;
}
```

> **Note**: If Joule has generated a different code for the service than the sample above, then provide this one instead of the one generated by Joule.
