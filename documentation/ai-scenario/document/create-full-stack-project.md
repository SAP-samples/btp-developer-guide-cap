# Create a Full-Stack Application

This section explains how to access the SAP Build lobby and create a full-stack application using SAP Build Code.

> The Joule prompt is designed to generate the complete code required for successfully developing a full-stack application in SAP Build Code powered by Joule. These prompts are specifically crafted to align with the hands-on tutorial flow, ensuring that each step can be executed sequentially and seamlessly.

1. Open the SAP Build Lobby.

2. Click on **Create** from **Create** dropdown.

6. Under **Name** tab, do the following:
    1. Enter the Name as `Incidents<your-initials><unique-random-number>`. For example, if your name is `John Doe`, then the project name would be **Incidentsjd12**, (12 is some random number).

        > **Note:** The project name should be unique to identify your project during deployment and also to avoid a duplication error.
    2. Let **Full_Stack** be the default Dev Space.

    3. Click on **Review**.

> [!Note]
> If the UI shows Dev space with New option, you can choose the existing Dev Space instead of creating a new one.
