## Set Up Initial Data for Incident Management Application

1. Open the `schema.cds` file and add the following code snippets:

    1. Under `Incidents` entity, add the `solutions`.

        ```sh
        solutions    : Composition of many {
            key ID    : UUID;
            confidence : String;
            solution   : String;
        };
        ```

    2. Add a new entity called `vectorEmbeddings`.

        ```sh
        entity vectorEmbeddings : cuid, managed{
            metadata   : LargeString;
            text_chunk : LargeString;
            embedding  : Vector(1536);
            solution   : LargeString;
        }
        ```

2. The sample data generated in the previous steps, creates the **data** folder in the **test** folder. To use the data for productive usage, move the **data** folder to the **db** folder. Open the terminal, and run the following command to move the CSV files.

    ```sh
    mv test/data db/data
    ```

3. Run the productive build for your application:

    ```sh
    cds build --production
    ```

4. Deploy the csv files to the SAP HANA database:

    ```sh
    cds deploy --to hana
    ```
 
    > [!Note]
    > It might take a few seconds to finish the deployment to SAP HANA. Once done, you get the successful deployment message.
