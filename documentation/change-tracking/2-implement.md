# Implement Change Tracking

In this tutorial, you will learn how to incorporate the change tracking feature into an existing Incident management application.

## Setup

Since you already have the Incident Mnagement application set up in your preferred IDE, let's include the following *npm* dependency.

1. Open **Terminal** >> **New Terminal**
2. Enter the following command

```sh
npm add @cap-js/change-tracking
```

The package is a *cds-plugin*, which means it automatically handles many aspects, reducing the need for extensive configurations and annotations.

## Annotate the Models

Once you've included the *cds-plugin*, proceed to insert the `@changelog` annotations into the entities that you want to track changes for in the `processor-service.cds` file.

Add the below annotations into `processor-service.cds` file.

```cds
annotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: {
  keys: [ customer.name, createdAt ]
} {
  title    @changelog;
  status   @changelog;
  customer @changelog: [ customer.name ];
};

annotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: {
  keys: [ author, timestamp ]
} {
  message  @changelog;
}
```

In this context, the entities **Incidents** and **Conversations** have been annotated to monitor changes, specifying key fields and attributes to be tracked selectively. For instance, we have chosen to track modifications for the **title**, **status**, and **customer** attributes specifically, rather than monitoring all fields.

# Summary

The essential changes have been successfully implemented, and now it's time to deploy the application to utilize its capabilities.
