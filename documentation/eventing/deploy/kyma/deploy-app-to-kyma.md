# Deploy and Run the Application on Kyma with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Backend

## Usage Scenario

Deploy the project to SAP BTP Kyma runtime using Helm configurations. See [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

## Prepare for Production

1. Navigate to `package.json` file in the root folder of your application.

2. Add `"@sap/xb-msg-amqp-v100": "^0"` to the **dependencies** section of `package.json ` file.

5. Create a new file called `event-mesh.json` at the root folder of the project and copy the content below. 

     - As **EM_NAME**, enter a speaking name for your client (e.g. inci).
       > The value of the EM_NAME property should have maximum length of 4 characters.

        ```json
        {
        "emname": "<EM_NAME>",
        "version": "1.1.0",
        "namespace": "default/incidents/1",
        "options": {
            "management": true,
            "messagingrest": true,
            "messaging": true
        },
        "rules": {
            "topicRules": {
            "publishFilter": [
                "${namespace}/*"
            ],
            "subscribeFilter": [
                "*"
            ]
            },
            "queueRules": {
            "publishFilter": [
                "${namespace}/*"
            ],
            "subscribeFilter": [
                "${namespace}/*"
            ]
            }
        },
        "authorities": [
            "$ACCEPT_GRANTED_AUTHORITIES"
        ]
        }
        ```

## Build Images
To transform source code (or artifacts) into container images, we recommend using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/).

For local development scenarios, you can use the [pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) CLI to consume Cloud Native Buildpacks. 

For more information, see [About Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma?impl-variant=node#about-cloud-native-buildpacks).

Log in to your container registry:

```sh
docker login docker.io -u <your-user>

```
## Before You Begin

Please note:

If you're using any device with a non-x86 processor (e.g. MacBook M1/M2), you need to instruct the Docker to use x86 images by setting the **DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM** environment variable: *export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64*.
See [Environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#environment-variables).

### Build CAP Node.js Image

1. Do the productive build for your application, which writes into the `gen/srv` folder:

    ```sh
    cds build --production
    ```

2. Build the image after updating version `<image-version>` to reflect the change in `incident-management-srv` app:

    ```sh
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv:<image-version> \
        --path gen/srv \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

**Info**
The pack CLI builds the image that contains the build result in the `gen/srv` folder and the required npm packages by using the [Packet Jammy Base Builder](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/builder-jammy-base).

### Build UI Deployer Image

 Build the image:
 
  ```sh
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path app/incidents \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
  ```

### Build Database Image 

Build the database image:

```sh
pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-hana-deployer:<image-version> \
     --path gen/db \
     --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
     --publish
```

## Configuration to use SAP S/4HANA Cloud system
> This section is relevant only if you are going to use SAP S/4HANA Cloud system as your remote service.

Create a new file called `s4cems.json` at the root folder of the project and copy the below content.
 
 - As **emClientId**, enter a speaking name for your client (e.g. INCI).
 - As **systemName**, enter the name of your the registered SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. 

    ```json
        {
        "emClientId": "<EMID>", 
        "systemName": "<SYSTEM_NAME>"
        }
    ``` 

2. Navigate to `chart/Chart.yaml` file from the project root folder.

3. Add the following code snippet to the `Chart.yaml` to create SAP S/4HANA Cloud extensibility service instance with messaging plan

    ```yaml
    - name: service-instance
        alias: s4-hana-cloud-messaging
        version: ">0.0.0"
    ```

4. Add the below configurations for `s4-hana-cloud` to the `values.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    s4-hana-cloud-messaging:
        serviceOfferingName: s4-hana-cloud
        servicePlanName: messaging
    ```

## Eventing Configuration

1. Add a configuration to create SAP Event Mesh service instance in `values.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
  event-mesh:
    serviceOfferingName: enterprise-messaging
    servicePlanName: default
  ```

2. Find `srv/bindings` object in values.yaml file and add SAP Event Mesh instance to it

  ```yaml
  srv:
    bindings:
      event-mesh:
        serviceInstanceName: event-mesh
  ```

3. Add following confirguration to `chart/Chart.yaml` for SAP Event Mesh instance creation

  ```yaml
  - name: service-instance
    alias: event-mesh
    version: ">0.0.0"
  ```

## Deploy Helm Chart
Once your cluster is prepared, your container images are built and uploaded to a registry, and your Helm chart is created, you're almost set for deploying your Kyma application.

### Configure Access to Your Container Images

Add your container image settings to your `chart/values.yaml`:

```yaml{4,7,8,9,13,14,18,19,23,24}
...
global:
  imagePullSecret:
    name: [<image pull secret name>] 
...
srv:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv
    tag: <srv-image-version>
...
hana-deployer:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-hana-deployer
    tag: <db-deployer-image-version>
...
html5-apps-deployer:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer
    tag: <html5apps-deployer-image-version>
```   

## Deploy CAP Helm Chart

1. Log in to your Kyma cluster.

2. Execute one of the below commands based on the integration scenarios

  a. For deploying the Incident Mnaagement Application together with SAPS/4HANA Cloud
  
    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incidents-namespace ./chart \
      --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json --set-file s4-hana-cloud.jsonParameters=bupa.json --set-file s4-hana-cloud-messaging.jsonParameters=s4cems.json --set-file event-mesh.jsonParameters=event-mesh.json
    ```

  b. For deploying the Incident Mnaagement Application together with Mock Server
  
    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incidents-namespace ./chart \
      --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json --set-file event-mesh.jsonParameters=event-mesh.json
    ```

This installs the Helm chart from the chart folder with the release name ***incident-management*** in the namespace ***incidents-namespace***.

> With the ***helm upgrade --install*** command you can install a new chart as well as upgrade an existing chart.

The outcome of installation will look something like this:

To be able to access the application via the URL, you have to [Assign Application Roles](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/user-role-assignment.html).

As a next step, to access the application in launchpad, proceed to [Integrate with SAP Build Workzone](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/integrate-with-work-zone.html).
