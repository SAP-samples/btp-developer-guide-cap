# Introduction

SAPUI5 is the standard framework that you can use to freely develop your application user interface as you wish. The free style approach of using SAPUI5 offers complete flexibility about how the application can look and perform. You can also specify the layout, flow, menu structure, interaction patterns, and so on.

# Freestyle SAPUI5 Application

In this tutorial, we extend the Incident Management application to create the Manager Dashboard using the freestyle SAPUI5 approach. This feature provides managers with a visual Geo map overview of customer locations, allowing them to click on markers to access a detailed screen showcasing incidents categorized by **status** (New, In Progress, Closed) and filtered by **urgency** (High, Medium, Low). The dashboard also displays the duration since each incident was created, enabling quick assessment.
