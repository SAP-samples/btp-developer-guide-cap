# Setup CI/CD Pipeline

This section describes how to configure and run a predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service that automatically builds, tests and deploys your code changes to speed up your development and delivery cycles.
For more information, see See [SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/continuous-integration--delivery?region=all).

The steps below guide you through setting up your pipeline.

1. Develop the Incident Management application following the step by step tutorial [Develop a Full-Stack CAP Application](https://developers.sap.com/group.cap-application-full-stack.html)
2. Deploy the Incident Management application to SAP BTP Kyma Runtime following the tutorial [Deploy a Full-Stack CAP Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://developers.sap.com/group.deploy-full-stack-cap-kyma-runtime.html)

## Initialize a Repository in VS Code

To be able to perform the steps for setting up a CI/CD pipeline, you need a public repository. Currently, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery supports **GitHub** and **Bitbucket** repositories.

For real application development, you need to consider the right place for your repository.

In this example, we’ll be creating a repository on GitHub. You need a **GitHub** account for this step.

1. In VS Code, navigate to **Explorer** and choose **Open Folder**. 
![openFolder](./cicd28.png)

2. Open the folder which contains your Incident Management application.

3. Navigate to the project's root folder and check if file `.gitignore` is present. 

4. If your project already has a .gitignore file, ensure that the following snippet is added in it. Additionally if `resources/` is mentioned in the file, remove it. If there is no .gitignore file present, create a file and add below code snippet
 
    ```
    node_modules/
    package-lock.json
    gen/

    *.mtar
    mta_archives/
    mta.yaml
    ```


5. Now navigate to **Source Control** and choose **Initialize Repository**.
![initializeRepo](./cicd29.png)

6. Stage all the changes using the **+** icon and provide a relevant commit message. Then click on Commit.
![commit](./cicd30.png)

7. Click **Publish Branch** and select the repository name to publish code to Github repository
![publish](./cicd31.png)

    You may be redirected to a browser to authenticate into your GitHub account. Provide your GitHub username and password when prompted. When the changes are pushed, you’ll be able to see your project in your GitHub repository.

## Setup the Continuous Integration and Delivery Service

1. Enable SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.
    - In SAP BTP Cockpit, go to your subaccount.
    - In Service Marketplace, type Continuous into the search box. Continuous Integration and Delivery service appears.
    - Choose **Create**.
    ![Choose create](./cicd1.png)

2. Assign role collection.

    - In your SAP BTP subaccount, choose **Security -> Users**.
    - Choose the name of your identity provider and navigate into it.
    - From the menu, choose **Assign Role Collection**. Search for *CICD Administrator* and add the role to your user.

3. Ensure that you can open and access the application. In the cockpit,  go to **Instances and Subscriptions** to access the **Continuous Integration & Delivery** application.
![cicd-app](./cicd3.png)

    This should navigate you to the main page of the application.
![cicd-mainPage](./cicd4.png)

<br>

**NOTE:**
**If you intend to deploy this application on a cluster that has a previous deployment of the same application, it is recommended to undeploy this old installation via your terminal using the command:**
```
helm uninstall incident-management -n <namespace>
```


## Retrieve Kyma Cluster Configuration Details

In order to run the pipeline using the CI/CD service, you need to create a service account. To do this, follow the steps.

1. First you need to create a namespace. In the SAP BTP Cockpit, open the **Kyma Dashboard** for your subaccount. 

    ![dashboard](./cicd2.png)

    Your dashboard should look like this.
![kyma-dashboard](./cicd54.png)

2. In the left navigation menu, choose **Namespaces** and then choose **Create**. 
![namespacePage](./cicd44.png)

3. Provide any relevant name of your choice e.g: `incidents-namespace`. Enable the slider for **Enable Sidecar Injection** and choose **Create**.
![namespaceCreation](./cicd45.png)

4. For this namespace, you need to create a Service Account. This is a non-human account which will authenticate your pipeline to access your cluster. See [Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/). 

    - Ensure you are in your created namespace. From the left navigation menu, click on the dropdown **Configuration** and navigate to **Service Accounts**. Here click on **Create**.
    ![serviceAccountPage](./cicd46.png)

    - Give your service account a name `incidents-namespace-service-account` and choose **Create**.
    ![serviceAccountCreation](./cicd47.png)

5. For your pipeline to access your Kyma cluster through this service account, it requires a set of configurations. This is defined in the **KubeConfig** file of the account. To retrieve this, follow the below steps
    - Ensure you are on the page of the created service account and click on **Generate TokenRequest**. 
    ![kubeConfig](./cicd48.png)

    - From the **Expiration seconds** dropdown, select the maximum duration.
    ![kubeConfig](./cicd49.png)
    
    - The configuration details should mention a token, your Kyma cluster and namespace, and choose **Copy**.
    ![configDetails](./cicd50.png)

6. You need to add your service account to a **Cluster Role Binding**. For this go back to your **Cluster Details** page. 
![clusterRoleBinding](./cicd51.png)

    From the left navigation menu, choose **Configurations** and navigate to **Cluster Role Bindings**. Here click on **Create**.
![binding](./cicd52.png)

7. On **Create Cluster Role Binding** page, fill in the following details:

    - Name : Give <unique_relevant_name>
    - Role : Choose **cluster-admin** from the dropdown.
    - Kind : Choose **ServiceAccount** from the dropdown.
    - Service Account Namespace : Choose the relevant namespace from the dropdown where the service account is created.
    - Service Account Name : Choose the created service account from the dropdown.

        Your details page should look like this:
        ![custer-role-binding](./cicd53.png)

    - Now click on create. You should see your newly created Cluster Role Binding

8. Navigate to the Continuous Integration and Delivery Application. On this page, choose **Credentials** and click on the **\+** to create a new credential. 

    Choose a relevant name for your credential e.g: kube-config. For type, choose **Kubernetes Configuration** from the dropdown. In the **Content space**, paste the KubeConfig file of the service account you copied from the previous step. Choose Create.
    ![credential](./cicd12.png)

## Get Docker Credentials
For your pipeline to be able to push and pull images from your docker repository, you need to set your docker credentials for your job. 

1. To run this pipeline you would need your credentials to be base64-encoded. To obtain these credentials, login to your registry from the terminal:
    ```
    docker --config /tmp login docker.io
    ```
    Provide your credentials if prompted.

2. Run the command:
    ```
    cat /tmp/config.json
    ```
    You should see the output below
    ```json
    {
        "auths": {
            "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
        },
        "credsStore": "osxkeychain"
    }   
    ```
3. In order retrieve the credentials in desired format, you will have to remove the `credsStore` key-value pair along with the preceding comma. To modify the config.json file run the following command and modify the file from the editor.
    ```
    code /tmp/config.json
    ```
    Ensure to save your changes.

4. Run the same `docker login` command mentioned in step 1. You will need to input your docker credentials again. 

    Print the credentials again using the `cat command` mentioned in step 2. Ensure your credentials are in this form
    ```json
    {
        "auths": {
            "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {       
                "auth": "abc...xyz"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
2. Now add these docker credentials as a CI/CD credential. Navigate to the Continuous Integration and Delivery Application (follow the steps mentioned above). On this page choose **Credentials** and click on the **\+** to create a new credential. 

    Choose a relevant name for your credential e.g: docker-config. For **Type**, choose **Container Registry Configuration** from the dropdown. In the **Content** space, paste the docker configurations you retrieved from the previous step.
    
    You additionally need to modify the `auths` object's url of your credentials. Remove the `https://` and `/v1/`. Now choose **Create**.

    Ensure your credentials are in the form shown below. 
![credentials](./cicd16.png)

## Prepare Your Code

1. Open the `package.json` file and add the below script  `cds-build` and devDependency `@cap-js/sqlite`
    ```json
        {
        "devDependencies": {
           "@cap-js/sqlite": "^1",
            ...

            },
        "scripts": {
            . . .
            "cds-build": "npm install --include=dev && cds build --production"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
2. Remove the following from the same `package.json` file

    - `rimraf` from `devDependencies`
    - `undeploy`, `build and deploy` from `scripts` 

3. From the terminal, run the following command:
   ```
   npm add -D @sap/cds-dk
   ```
   This will add `@sap/cds-dk` as a devDependency to the same package.json file.

4. Push these changes to your main branch from the **Source Control** by first staging and committing.
