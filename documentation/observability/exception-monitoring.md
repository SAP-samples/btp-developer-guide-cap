# Integration & Exception Monitoring
The purpose of Integration & Exception Monitoring is to provide transparency for the data exchange processes. It supports the monitoring for peer-to-peer interfaces as well as interfaces using orchestration platforms and provides a unified user experience for all interface types using a common look-and-feel and handling pattern. 

Integration & Exception Monitoring closes the gap between IT and Business. The correlation of integration artifacts provides end-to-end visibility in interface calls and message flows cross all involved cloud services and systems.

Users of Integration & Exception Monitoring can analyze the actual processing of interface calls and message flows including possible technical or business-driven root causes.

Integration & Exception Monitoring provides the following functionalities:

- Message Monitoring
- Message Search (Tracking)
- Alerting on failed messages or exceptions

**Exception monitoring for Incident Management will follow soon.** For guidance on implementing this in your application, please refer to the [Expert Portal.](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/integration-monitoring.html)
