## SAP Cloud ALM  and SAP Cloud Logging
[SAP Cloud ALM](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html?anchorId=section_copy), and [SAP Cloud Logging](https://help.sap.com/docs/application-logging-service?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=Validation) can work together to ensure centralized access control, logging, monitoring, and analysis of SAP applications and services running in the cloud environment.


## Scope 
In this section, you'll see how to connect a CAP application to your Cloud ALM tenant in order to get Real User Monitoring and Health Monitoring insights.

### Real User Monitoring
The purpose of Real User Monitoring is to provide transparency about the usage (executions) and the performance (response times) of user interactions. It supports the monitoring of request executions from different platforms with a unified user experience using a common look-and-feel and handling pattern. 

The basic concept is to get all user interactions and the relevant server requests that are correlated in the Real User Monitoring application. Request executions are rated based on historical values and not based on fixed thresholds.

Real User Monitoring helps IT users and business users understand how often applications are executed and what are the response times for the users. 
[See Real User Monitoring](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/real-user-monitoring.html) for more details. 

### Health Monitoring
In the Health Monitoring application, you can check the health of your monitored cloud service and technical systems from an application and customer perspective. Technical metrics are collected regularly and can be used to calculate the overall health of the monitored object. The monitored metrics are defined by the service itself and may differ for each service type. See [Health Monitoring](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/health-monitoring.html) for more details.
