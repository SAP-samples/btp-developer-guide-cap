# Prepare application to Deploy to Kyma/K8s

## Preliminary Setup
- [Download your project from SAP Business Application Studio](#download-and-setup-the-project-locally), unzip and import it into Visual Studio Code.
- [Prepare for SAP BTP Development with Kyma Runtime]()
- [SAP BTP Operator Module is enabled](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-and-disable-kyma-module#loio1b548e9ad4744b978b8b595288b0cb5c)
- Download and install the following command line tools:
  - [kubectl command line client for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is a paid subscription and it costs approx 12.45 EUR/Month
  - [pack command line tool](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/)
  - [helm command line tool](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Access Kyma instance using kubectl](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/access-kyma-instance-using-kubectl?locale=244dbc262b5c4d37a42cfd7405e4719e.html)
- Use the image artifactory recommended by your organization. Incase if you dont have an artifactory you can use [dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/quickstart/) for a non-productive usage.

## Overview
SAP BTP, Kyma runtime is a cloud-native application runtime that combines the power of Kubernetes with a set of best-in-class tools and open-source components that empower you to develop, run, and operate secure and scalable cloud-native applications. Detailed information is available at [Kyma Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-environment).
The Kyma runtime for SAP BTP's files are provided as a container image. In addition, since the containers run on Kubernetes, their configuration is described by Kubernetes resources.

Hence, two kinds of artifacts are needed to run applications on Kubernetes:

1. Container images
2. Kubernetes resources

You start by building your project as container images and push those images to a container registry of your choice. Then, you add a [CAP Helm chart](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma#about-cap-helm) to your project. As a last step, you deploy the Helm chart to your Kyma resources, where service instances of SAP BTP services are created and pods pull the previously created container images from the container registry.

## Get Access to a Container Registry
SAP BTP doesn't provide a container registry.

You can choose from offerings of hosted open source and private container image registries, as well as solutions that can be run on premise or in your own cloud infrastructure. However, you need to consider that the Kubernetes cluster needs to access the container registry from its network.

The use of a public container registry gives everyone access to your container images.
In a private container registry, your container images are protected. You will need to configure a pull secret to allow your cluster to access it.

### Setup Your Cluster for a Public Container Registry
Make sure that the container registry is accessible from your Kubernetes cluster. No further setup is required.

### Setup Your Cluster for a Private Container Registry
To use a container image from a private repository, you need to create an image pull secret and configure this secret for your containers.

---
**Warning:**
It is recommended to use a technical user for this secret that has only read permission, because users with access to the Kubernetes cluster can reveal the password from the secret easily.

---

## Download and Setup the Project Locally
1. In SAP Business Application Studio, right click on the project folder (`Incidents-app``) and choose **Download**.
![Generated Charts1](./images/downloadproject.png)

2. Extract the downloaded file `incidents-app.tar`.

3. Open a command line window.

4. Open the project in VS code:
  ```bash
  code incidents-app
  ```

## Add Configurations for UI

The `cds add helm` command supports deployment to the HTML5 application repository which can be used with both standalone app router and managed app router. See [UI Deployment](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma#ui-deployment).

[HTML5 application deployer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/html5-app-deployer/v/5.0.0) handles the upload of the HTML5 applications content to the HTML5 application repository.
Below the root folder, the HTML5 applications deployer looks for the `resources` folder which has the static files of the HTML5 application.

1. Create a new folder called `resources` under `app/incidents` and move `webapp` folder to `resources`.

2. Open `app/incidents/package.json` and add the following code snippet:

        ```json
        {
            "name": "incidents",
            "version": "0.0.1",
            "description": "A Fiori application.",
            "keywords": [
                "ui5",
                "openui5",
                "sapui5"
            ],
            "main": "webapp/index.html",
            "scripts": {
                "start": "node node_modules/@sap/html5-app-deployer/index.js",
                "deploy-config": "npx -p @sap/ux-ui5-tooling fiori add deploy-config cf"
            },
            "dependencies": {  
                "@sap/html5-app-deployer": "5.0.0"
              },
            "devDependencies": { }
        }
        ```
3. Move `xs-app.json` from `app/incidents` to `app/incidents/resources/webapp`
4. Open `app/incidents/resources/webapp/xs-app.json` and add the following code snippet:

        ```json
        {
            "source": "^/odata/v4/processors/(.*)$",
            "destination": "srv-api",
            "authenticationType": "xsuaa"
        },
        ```
5. Open `app/incidents/resources/webapp/manifest.json` and remove the leading `/` from the `uri`

```json
  {
      "mainService": {
          "uri": "odata/v4/processors/",
          "type": "OData",
          "settings": {
              "annotations": [],
              "localUri": "localService/metadata.xml",
              "odataVersion": "4.0"
          }
      }
  }

```

This is needed as the dataSource URIs must be relative to the base URL, which means there is no need for a slash as the first character.

For more information refer the [document](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/accessing-business-service-ui?locale=39723061bc4b4b679726b120cbefdf5a.html&q=base%20URL)

6. Add the below code snippet to the end of `manifest.json` file

  ```json
  "sap.cloud": {
        "public": true,
        "service": "incidents"
  }
  ```

7. Delete `node-modules` and `package-lock.json` if there are any inside `app/incidents` folder.

8. Run `npm i`

## Add Helm Chart

CAP provides a configurable Helm chart for Node.js and Java applications.

1. Run the below command to add helm charts:

    ```sh
    cds add helm
    ```

This command adds the Helm chart to the chart folder of your project.
The generated chart will look something like this:

<img src="./images/charts.png" width="30%" height="20%">

The files in the charts folder support the deployment of your CAP service, database and UI content, and the creation of instances for SAP BTP services.

2. Run the below command to automate the setup for HTML5 application deployment:

    ```sh
    cds add html5-repo
    ```

# Undeploy the Application

Based on the SAP BTP Runtime environment to which you had deployed your application, you can choose one of the below two options:
  
## Undeploy application from Cloud Foundry

Run the below command to undeploy your application from SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Runtime

  ```sh
  cf undeploy <YOUR_MTA_ID> --delete-services
  ```

**info**
Replace `YOUR_MTA_ID` in the above command with the `ID` from mta.yaml file.

## Undeploy application from Kyma Runtime

Run the below command to undeploy your application from SAP BTP Kyma Runtime

  ```sh
  helm uninstall <RELEASE_NAME> -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
  ```
