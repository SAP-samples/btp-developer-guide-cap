# Deploy and Run the Application on Kyma with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Backend

## Usage Scenario

Deploy the project to Kyma using Helm configurations.

## Build Images
To transform source code (or artifacts) into container images, we recommend using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/).
For local development scenarios, you can use the [pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) CLI to consume Cloud Native Buildpacks. 
For more information, see [About Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma?impl-variant=node#about-cloud-native-buildpacks).

Log in to your container registry:

```sh
docker login docker.io -u <your-user>

```
## Before You Begin

Please note:

If you're using any device with a non-x86 processor (e.g. MacBook M1/M2), you need to instruct the Docker to use x86 images by setting the **DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM** environment variable: *export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64*.
See [Environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#environment-variables).

### Build CAP Node.js Image

1. Do the productive build for your application, which writes into the `gen/srv` folder:

    ```sh
    cds build --production
    ```

2. Build the image after updating version `<image-version>` to reflect the change in incident-management-srv app.

    ```sh
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv:<image-version> \
        --path gen/srv \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

**Info**
The pack CLI builds the image that contains the build result in the *gen/srv* folder and the required *npm* packages by using the [Packeto Jammy Base Builder](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/builder-jammy-base).

### Build UI Deployer image

1. Navigate to ui-resources folder from your projectâ€™s root folder and run the following command

    ```sh
    npm install && npm run package
    ```

2. Navigate back to the root folder of your project. Build the image:

    ```sh
    pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer:<image-version> \
        --path ui-resources \
        --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
        --publish
    ```

### Build Database Image 

To build the database image, run:

```sh
pack build <your-container-registry>/incident-management-hana-deployer:<image-version> \
     --path gen/db \
     --builder paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base \
     --publish
```

## Remote Service Configuration

1. Add the following code snippet to `chart/Chart.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  - name: service-instance
    alias: s4-hana-cloud
    version: ">0.0.0"
  ```

2. Add the following configurations for `s4-hana-cloud` service instance creation in `values.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  s4-hana-cloud:
    serviceOfferingName: s4-hana-cloud
    servicePlanName: api-access
  ```

For more information about Helm and CAP, see [About CAP Helm chart](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/deploy-to-kyma?impl-variant=node#about-cap-helm).


## Deploy Helm Chart
Once your cluster is prepared, your container images are built and uploaded to a registry, and your Helm chart is created, you're almost set for deploying your Kyma application.

### Configure Access to Your Container Images

1. Add your container image settings to your `chart/values.yaml`:

```yaml{4,7,8,9,13,14,18,19,23,24}
...
global:
  imagePullSecret:
    name: [<image pull secret name>] 
...
srv:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-srv
    tag: <srv-image-version>
...
hana-deployer:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-hana-deployer
    tag: <db-deployer-image-version>
...
html5-apps-deployer:
  image:
    repository: <your-container-registry>/incident-management-html5-deployer
    tag: <html5apps-deployer-image-version>

```

## Deploy CAP Helm Chart

1. Log in to your Kyma cluster.

2. Execute one of the below commands based on the integration scenarios

  a. For deploying the Incident Mnaagement Application together with SAPS/4HANA Cloud
  
    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incident-management ./chart \
       --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json --set-file s4-hana-cloud.jsonParameters=bupa.json
    ```

  b. For deploying the Incident Mnaagement Application together with Mock Server
  
    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install incident-management --namespace incidents-namespace ./chart \
      --set-file xsuaa.jsonParameters=xs-security.json
    ```
  ```
This installs the Helm chart from the chart folder with the release name ***incident-management*** in the namespace ***incident-management***.

```info
With the ***helm upgrade --install*** command, you can install a new chart as well as upgrade an existing chart.
```

The outcome of installation looks similar to this:

To be able to access the application via the URL, you have to [Assign Application Roles](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/user-role-assignment.html).

As a next step, to access the application in launchpad, proceed to [Integrate with SAP Build Workzone](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/integrate-with-work-zone.html).
