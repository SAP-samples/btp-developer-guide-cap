# Prepare the Project for Production

## Usage Scenario

To use the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility service to access the Business Partner API, you need some additional configurations.


## Prerequisites

You have set up the connection to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. See [Configure the connectivity between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP](../../s4hana-cloud-to-btp-connectivity/README.md). 

## Content

1. Create a new file *bupa.json* in the root folder of the project and copy the content below

- For **systemName**, enter the name of your registered SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. 
- For **communicationArrangementName**, enter a speaking name for your communication arrangement (e.g. INCIDENT_MANAGEMENT_0008).


    ```json

2.  Navigate to the *package.json* file in the root folder of the application. Replace the settings for **API_BUSINESS_PARTNER** with the following code snippet:
    ```json
    "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
        "kind": "odata-v2",
        "model": "srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER",
        "[production]": {
            "credentials": {
                "destination": "<DESTINATION_NAME>",
                "path": "/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
