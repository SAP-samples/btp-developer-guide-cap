# Explore APIs & events in SAP Business Accelerator Hub

The SAP Business Accelerator Hub is a web application hosted by SAP to discover, explore, and test SAP and partner APIs (application programming interfaces) that are required to build extensions or process integrations.

Go through the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/) and check whether these APIs can help you complete your extension scenario. 

For our scenario we use the Business Partner API from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

### Get the Business Partner API

Download the [Business Partner API (A2X) from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview). Go to section _API Resources_, select _API Specification_, and select the _EDMX_ file. You will need this file in a later section.
