# Get the Business Partner API

SAP Business Accelerator Hub is a web application hosted by SAP where you can discover, explore, and test SAP and partner APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that are required to build extensions or process integrations.

In the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/), you can find the APIs that you need to complete your extension scenario. 

For our scenario, we use the Business Partner API from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
