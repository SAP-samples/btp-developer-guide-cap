## Business Scenario

In this tutorial, we will integrate SAP S/4 HANA Cloud Business Partner API to the Incident Management application.

When a new incident is created by the processor, he or she has to assign the incident to a customer on behalf of whom they are receiving a phone call. The option to choose a customer will be given as a value help and the list of customers in the value help will be fetched from an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. You will be using [S/4HANA Business Partner API](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview) to fetch the list of customers.
