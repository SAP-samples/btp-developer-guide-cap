## Business Scenario

In this tutorial, we will integrate SAP S/4 HANA Cloud Business Partner API to the Incident Management Application.

When a new incident is created by the processor, he/she had to assign the incident to a customer on behalf of whom they are receiving the phone call. This option to choose customer will be given as a value help and the list of customers in the value help will be fetched from SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. We will be using [S/4HANA Business Partner API](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview) for the same.
